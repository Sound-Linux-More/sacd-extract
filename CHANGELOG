Version: sacd_extract 0.3.9.3-75
- changed in how the content of TPE1 (Artist name) of ID3 tag is filled. If Disc/Album artist or Performer are missing from the SACD, then the TPE1 is no longer created;

Version: sacd_extract 0.3.9.3-71-g781ecde73214576cf7dee777ed07511f98f7784d

added UTF-16 encodings with BOM for ID3v2.3 tags;
added id3tag=3 option for creating DSF files with ID3V2.3 tags and string encodings ISO-8859-1 (ASCII);
The ID3 tags will be created:
(id3tag=1) in ID3V2.3 version with full metadata. String encodings is UTF-16 with BOM (UCS-2);
(id3tag=2) in ID3V2.3 version with minimal medatadata*. String encodings is UTF-16 with BOM (UCS-2);
(id3tag=3) in ID3V2.3 version with full metadata. String encodings is ISO-8859-1 (ASCII);
(id3tag=4) in ID3V2.4 version with full metadata. String encodings is UTF-8;
(id3tag=5) in ID3V2.4 version with minimal metadata*. String encodings is UTF-8;
(id3tag=0) ID3tag will not be created (for testing and experimental purpose).
now the default format for ID3 tags will be ID3v2.4 format (with UTF-8 encodings).
Note: * minimal metadata contains only 4 elements: Track Title, Album Title, Artist Name and Track Number.

- added id3tag=0 (or =1, =2, =4, =5) option. At DSF conversion the ID3 tags will be created:
	- (=1) in ID3V2.3 version with full metadata (Default) or with minimal medatadata* (=2);
	- (=4) in ID3V2.4 version with full metadata  or with minimal medatadata* (=5);
	- if =0 then ID3tag will not be created (for testing and experimental purpose).    

	*Minimal metadata contains only 4 elements: Track Title, Album Title, Artist Name and Track Number.

Version: 0.3.9.3-51-gdeed25c3d4515e9d878c3e855cb72324958aafdf pre-release
- added concatenation option -k (--concatenate). Used in conjunction with track selection to concatenate selected tracks. Designed only for DSF format. Also, concatenate option can be set in 'sacd_extract.cfg' file as 'concatenate=1'. This allow to work ok with SACDExtractGui; Padding-less option for concatenation can be set also in 'sacd_extract.cfg' (to override the same option in SACDExtractGui which is disabled when tracks selection is enabled).Example 'nopad=0';
- fixed a bug in ID3 tag (where missing a null terminal in id3 tag text frames);
- ID3 tag are using now UTF-8 encoding;
- now 'artist' -A (--artist), 'performer' -a (--performer) and 'pauses' -b (--pauses) options can be declared in command line;

Binaries compiled with cross compiler mingw64 for Windows (64bit) & Gnu 7.4.0 for Linux.
- fixed infinite loop 99% when iso files are corrupted;
- added Performer tag to dsf files;
- multi-byte chars in filenames is supported for Windows when input files are iso (using wmain);
- better management in creating folders/files/tracks names (including albums with multiple discs);
- folders are created like this: Album name/(Disc no)/(Stereo or 5ch or 6ch). If configuration file sacd_extract.cfg exist in working folder of app(which can be shown with -v option) and has text lines: 'artist=1' (and/or 'performer=1') it adds artist at the name of folder and/or adds performer at the filename of tracks;
- changed priority in title/artist extracting metadata. Now disc_title/disc_artist came first instead of album_title/album_artist (useful in case of multiple discs of an album);
- added -w (--concurrent) for compatibility with SACDExtractGUI;
- added -o (--output-dir[=DIR] ) and -y (--output-dir-conc[=DIR]) options for setting explicit output folder (for compatibility with SACDExtractGUI);
- for DSF/DFF files, the pops/crackles noise is reduced by trimming frames at track boundaries;
- audio frames are trimmed out (based on timecode) at boundaries to reflect the correct playing time of tracks specified in Tracklist. This is done for DSF/DFF files (no for DFF-EM);
- eliminates crashes when disk for output is full;
- corrected behavior in case of discs with only one multi-channel area (with no stereo area);
- added total play time for each area when printing disc info;
- now it strips out ending slash or backslash, if exists, at --output-dir or --output-dir-conc to be compatible with BatchEncoder;
- added xml metadata file export option (is activated when Cue sheet is checked). Libray libxml2 is used;
- added more integrity checks of the audio frames; 
- fixed 2 BUGS which can make pops/crackles noises at the end of DSF/DFF tracks;
- added -z (--dsf-nopad) option, (now is fully compatible with SACDExtractGUI);
- added 'audio_frame_trimming=1' option in sacd_extract.cfg (see above 'audio frames are trimmed out....').
